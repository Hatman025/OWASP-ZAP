Key Features
•	Automated Scanning: Quickly detects common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and insecure headers.
•	Manual Testing Tools: Includes intercepting proxy, request/response editors, and fuzzing capabilities.
•	Spidering & Crawling: Maps application endpoints to ensure full coverage during testing.
•	Extensible Add-ons: Supports plugins for advanced testing scenarios.
